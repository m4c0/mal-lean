# mal-lean

A leaner version of [Make-A-Lisp][mal].

This is a trimmed-down version of the source code available in the [Make-A-Lisp
repository][mal]. This is intended as a personal sandbox for experiments with
new languages, without the heavy-lift of tweaking with MAL's build system.

Effectively, this repository has a copy of MAL's tests and Python execution
script. This allows development on non-Linux systems - Windows lacks Make and
some Python libs, like termio.
